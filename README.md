## 📚 Git & Jira Naming Conventions

To ensure clarity and traceability across branches and commits, all contributors must follow the naming conventions outlined below.

---

### 🔀 Branch Naming Convention

All branches must follow the format:

ATLAS-[issue-number]: [short-description]

Where:

- `ATLAS-` is the **Jira project key**
- `<issue-number>` is the **Jira ticket number** (e.g., `123`)
- `<short-description>` is a **1–3 word summary** of the purpose (lowercase, hyphen-separated)

✅ **Example**:
ATLAS-123-add-login-feature

---

### ✅ Pull Request Message Convention

All pull request messages must follow this format:

ATLAS-[issue-number]: [type]-[short-description]

Where:

- `ATLAS-<issue-number>` refers to the corresponding Jira ticket (e.g., `ATLAS-123`)
- `<type>` must be either:
  - `feature`
  - `bugfix`
- `<short-description>` is a concise, lowercase, hyphen-separated summary (1–3 words)

✅ **Examples**:
ATLAS-123: feature-add-login
ATLAS-210: bugfix-fix-auth-error

### 📌 Additional Notes

- Use the "Create branch" button directly in Jira when possible — it helps auto-fill the correct format.
- Always open Pull Requests into the `dev` branch unless otherwise instructed.
- Avoid pushing directly to `main` or `dev`.
- Keep commit history clean and readable.
- Local pushes to `main` are blocked by a Git hook to prevent accidental changes.  
  Always work on feature branches and create a Pull Request to merge into `main`.

### 🐳 Running the Project with Docker Compose

To run the project using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. **Install Docker Desktop**
   - Download and install Docker Desktop from [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
   - Start Docker Desktop and wait until it is fully running (the whale icon should appear in your system tray).

2. **Build the Docker images (first time or after changes to dependencies):**

   ```sh
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. **Start the services:**

   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```

   - This will start the backend service (http://localhost:8000) and the frontend (http://localhost:3000).
   - Redis (localhost:6379)
   - PostgreSQL : localhost:5432
   - Flower (Celery Monitoring): http://localhost:5555

4. **Test the backend:**
   - In a new terminal, run:
     ```sh
     curl http://localhost:8000/ping
     ```
   - You should receive a response like `{ "message": "pong" }`.

5. **Test the frontend:**
   - Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000]
   - You should see the Atlas web application.

6. **Test db:**
   - In a terminal, run:

   ```sh
   curl http://localhost:8000/db-test
   ```

   - You should receive a response like `{"db_status":"connected","result":[1]}`

7. **Test Celery and Redis:**
   - In terminal, run:

   ```sh
      curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/test/simple"
   ```

   - You should receive: `{"task_id": random Id,"status":"Task started","message":"Task launched for World"}`

8. **Live Reload (Development):**
   - **Backend:** With Docker volumes and live reload enabled, any changes you make to the backend code will automatically restart the server inside the container.
   - **Frontend:** The frontend uses the Vite dev server with hot reload. Any changes to files will instantly reload the app in your browser.

9. **Stopping the services:**
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running Docker Compose, or run:
     ```sh
     docker-compose down
     ```

### ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline & Tests

To ensure reliability and consistency across the project, a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline is configured to automatically run tests on every pull request to main.

### 🧪 When Are Tests Run?

**Tests are automatically triggered when:**

- You open a Pull Request targeting the main branch
- You manually re-run GitHub Actions from the Actions tab

### 📦 What Does the CI/CD Pipeline Do?

1. **Builds Docker images for frontend and backend**

2. **Runs unit and integration tests inside containers:**
   - Backend: Python tests using pytest
   - Frontend: TypeScript tests using vitest

3. **Fails the PR if any test fails**

**You will see the test results directly in the Pull Request interface on GitHub under the “Checks” tab.**
✅ If all tests pass, your PR can be reviewed and merged
❌ If a test fails, the PR is blocked until the issue is resolved

### 🧰 How to Add New Tests

### ✅ Backend (Python – FastAPI)

1. **Create a new test file in the Backend-Atlas/tests/ folder.**
   Example: Backend-Atlas/tests/test_example.py

2. **Use the pytest framework:**
   def test_addition():
   assert 2 + 2 == 4

3. **Run locally inside the backend container:**
   docker compose run backend pytest

### ✅ Frontend (TypeScript – Vue + Vite + Vitest)

1. **Create a new file like ComponentName.test.ts inside Frontend-Atlas/tests/**

2. **Write your test using vitest:**
   import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'

   describe('math test', () => {
   it('adds numbers correctly', () => {
   expect(2 + 2).toBe(4)
   })
   })

3. **Run locally inside the frontend container:**
   docker compose run frontend npm run test

### Make sure vitest is installed. It’s already configured in the Dockerfile.

### ✅ Add Test-Only Dependencies

**If you need new dev tools or testing libraries:**

- Backend: add to requirements.txt
- Frontend: add to package.json as devDependencies

**Then rebuild containers:**
docker compose build

### 📌 Notes

- The CI/CD configuration is managed in .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Docker images used for testing are the same as in production to ensure reliability
- Test feedback will show directly in your PR — no manual test launching needed
